1. The recurrence for this quicksort algorithm using best case and picking the first element is T(N) = T(n-1) * Θ(N) because the algorithm would have a partition on all the elements except the pivot. With the pivot being T(0) it cancels out so we just have T(n-1) calls of quicksort and Θ(N) time for the partition. In this case Θ(n^2) is the final bound. The best case is if the pivot is chosen in the middle where T(N) = 2T(N/2) + Θ(N), where N/2 signals only have the elements are in the partition and there are 2 calls at each level for equal paritions. This means A = 2, B = 2, and C = n where Θ(nlogn) is the final bound.
